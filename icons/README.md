# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

## Required Icons:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (Windows computers often require this size)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store and installation)

## Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use a robot or AI-themed design (ðŸ¤–)
- Colors should match the extension theme: #667eea to #764ba2 gradient
- Icons should be clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Use PNG format with transparency
- Follow Google's Material Design guidelines

## Temporary Solution:
For development purposes, you can use any 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG files.
You can create simple icons using online tools like:
- Canva
- GIMP
- Photoshop
- Online icon generators

## Icon Content Suggestion:
A simple robot head or brain icon with the gradient colors would work well for this AI assistant extension.
